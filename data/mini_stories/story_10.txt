Once upon a time, there was a girl named Mia. Mia loved her jewelry. She had a big box full of pretty things. She liked to wear them all day. But at night, she had to sleep.
One day, Mia met a talking cat named Tom. Tom was a tough cat, but he was nice. Tom said, "Hi, Mia! I like your jewelry. Can I wear some too?" Mia said, "Yes, Tom. You can wear my jewelry, but we have to give it back before we sleep."
So, Mia and Tom played together. They wore the jewelry and had fun. They pretended to be kings and queens. They laughed and danced. But soon, the sun went down, and it was time for bed.
Mia said, "Tom, we must give back the jewelry now. It's time to sleep." Tom gave back the jewelry and said, "Thank you, Mia. I had fun today." They put the jewelry back in the box and went to sleep. Mia and Tom were happy, and they had sweet dreams.
