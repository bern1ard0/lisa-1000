Once upon a time, there was a kind farmer. He had a big cow. The cow was sad. The farmer did not know why.
One day, a little boy came to the farm. He saw the sad cow. The boy kneeled down to talk to the cow. "Why are you sad, cow?" he asked. The cow said, "I am lonely. I want a friend."
The kind farmer heard the cow. He wanted to help. So, he got another cow to be friends with the sad cow. The sad cow was happy now. They played together every day. And the kind farmer, the little boy, and the two cows all lived happily ever after.
