Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She had a pet cat named Tom. They loved to play together in the big green park near their house. One sunny day, they went to the park to play.
While playing, Tom saw a big sour lemon on the ground. He wanted to play with it, but when he touched it, it started to roll away. Tom ran after the lemon, trying to catch it. But as he ran, Tom got lost in the park. Lucy looked around, but she could not find Tom. She was very sad.
Lucy did not give up. She searched the park for her friend. At last, she found him near a big tree. Tom was trying to catch the lemon, but it vanished into a hole in the ground. Tom was happy to see Lucy again. They hugged and went back home together. They had a fun escape in the park, but they decided to leave the sour lemon behind.
