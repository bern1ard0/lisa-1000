Once upon a time, there was a little brown dog named Spot. He loved to play with his ball in the park. One sunny day, Spot saw a big goal on the other side of the park. He wanted to get his ball into the goal.
Spot ran fast with the ball in his mouth. He tried to kick the ball into the goal, but he was too small. Spot started to struggle. He tried again and again, but the ball would not go in.
Then, Spot had an idea. He asked his friend, a big brown horse named Buddy, for help. Buddy kicked the ball with his strong legs. The ball flew into the goal! Spot was so happy. He and Buddy played together all day long.
