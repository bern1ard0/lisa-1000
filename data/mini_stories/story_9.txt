Once upon a time, there was a big dog named Max. Max had a red collar that he wore every day. He loved to play and run in the park with his friends.
One day, Max saw a cat on a tree. He wanted to be friends with the cat. So, Max tried to stretch up to reach the cat. But he was not tall enough. He tried again and again, but he just couldn't reach the cat.
Max felt sad, but then he had an idea. He found a big box and put it under the tree. Max climbed on the box and stretched one more time. This time, he reached the cat! The cat and Max became good friends, and they played together every day.
