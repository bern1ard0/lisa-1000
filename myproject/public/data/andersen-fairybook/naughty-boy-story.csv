naughty-boy,"A long time ago, there lived an old poet, a thoroughly kind old poet."
naughty-boy,"As he was sitting one evening in his room, a dreadful storm arose without, and the rain streamed down from heaven."
naughty-boy,"But the old poet sat warm and comfortable in his chimney-corner, where the fire blazed and the roasting apple hissed."
naughty-boy,"""Those who have not a roof over their heads will be wetted to the skin,"" said the good old poet."
naughty-boy,"""Oh let me in! Let me in! I am cold, and I'm so wet!"""
naughty-boy,"exclaimed suddenly a child that stood crying at the door and knocking for admittance, while the rain poured down, and the wind made all the windows rattle."
naughty-boy,"""Poor thing!"" said the old poet, as he went to open the door."
naughty-boy,"There stood a little boy, quite naked, and the water ran down from his long golden hair."
naughty-boy,"He trembled with cold, and had he not come into a warm room he would most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest."
naughty-boy,"""Poor child!"" said the old poet, as he took the boy by the hand."
naughty-boy,"""Come in, come in, and I will soon restore thee! Thou shalt have wine and roasted apples, for thou art verily a charming child!"""
naughty-boy,And the boy was so really.
naughty-boy,His eyes were like two bright stars.
naughty-boy,"Although the water trickled down his hair, it waved in beautiful curls."
naughty-boy,"He looked exactly like a little angel, but he was so pale, and his whole body trembled with cold."
naughty-boy,"He had a nice little bow in his hand, but it was quite spoiled by the rain, and the tints of his many-colored arrows ran one into the other."
naughty-boy,"The old poet seated himself beside his hearth, and took the little fellow on his lap."
naughty-boy,"He squeezed the water out of his dripping hair, warmed his hands between his own, and boiled for him some sweet wine."
naughty-boy,"Then the boy recovered, his cheeks again grew rosy, he jumped down from the lap where he was sitting, and danced round the kind old poet."
naughty-boy,"""You are a merry fellow,"" said the old man."
naughty-boy,"""What's your name?"""
naughty-boy,"""My name is Cupid,"" answered the boy."
naughty-boy,"""Don't you know me? There lies my bow. It shoots well, I can assure you! Look, the weather is now clearing up, and the moon is shining clear again through the window."""
naughty-boy,"""Why, your bow is quite spoiled,"" said the old poet."
naughty-boy,"""That were sad indeed,"" said the boy, and he took the bow in his hand and examined it on every side."
naughty-boy,"""Oh, it is dry again, and is not hurt at all. The string is quite tight. I will try it directly."""
naughty-boy,"And he bent his bow, took aim, and shot an arrow at the old poet, right into his heart."
naughty-boy,"""You see now that my bow was not spoiled,"" said he laughing; and away he ran."
naughty-boy,"The naughty boy, to shoot the old poet in that way!"
naughty-boy,"He who had taken him into his warm room, who had treated him so kindly, and who had given him warm wine and the very best apples!"
naughty-boy,"The poor poet lay on the earth and wept, for the arrow had really flown into his heart."
naughty-boy,"""Fie!"" said he."
naughty-boy,"""How naughty a boy Cupid is! I will tell all children about him, that they may take care and not play with him, for he will only cause them sorrow and many a heartache."""
naughty-boy,"And all good children to whom he related this story, took great heed of this naughty Cupid; but he made fools of them still, for he is astonishingly cunning."
naughty-boy,"When the university students come from the lectures, he runs beside them in a black coat, and with a book under his arm."
naughty-boy,"It is quite impossible for them to know him, and they walk along with him arm in arm, as if he, too, were a student like themselves."
naughty-boy,"Then, unperceived, he thrusts an arrow to their bosom."
naughty-boy,"When the young maidens come from being examined by the clergyman, or go to church to be confirmed, there he is again close behind them."
naughty-boy,"Yes, he is forever following people."
naughty-boy,"At the play, he sits in the great chandelier and burns in bright flames, so that people think it is really a flame, but they soon discover it is something else."
naughty-boy,"He roves about in the garden of the palace and upon the ramparts: yes, once he even shot your father and mother right in the heart."
naughty-boy,Ask them only and you will hear what they'll tell you.
naughty-boy,"Oh, he is a naughty boy, that Cupid; you must never have anything to do with him."
naughty-boy,He is forever running after everybody.
naughty-boy,"Only think, he shot an arrow once at your old grandmother!"
naughty-boy,"But that is a long time ago, and it is all past now; however, a thing of that sort she never forgets."
naughty-boy,"Fie, naughty Cupid!"
naughty-boy,"But now you know him, and you know, too, how ill-behaved he is!"
