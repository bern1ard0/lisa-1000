the-teapot,"THERE was once a proud teapot; it was proud of being porcelain, proud of its long spout, proud of its broad handle."
the-teapot,"It had something before and behind,--the spout before and the handle behind,--and that was what it talked about."
the-teapot,"But it did not talk of its lid, which was cracked and riveted; these were defects, and one does not talk of one's defects, for there are plenty of others to do that."
the-teapot,"The cups, the cream pot, and the sugar bowl, the whole tea service, would think much oftener of the lid's imperfections--and talk about them--than of the sound handle and the remarkable spout."
the-teapot,The teapot knew it.
the-teapot,"""I know you,"" it said within itself."
the-teapot,"""I know, too, my imperfection, and I am well aware that in that very thing is seen my humility, my modesty. Imperfections we all have, but we also have compensations. The cups have a handle, the sugar bowl a lid; I have both, and one thing besides, in front, which they can never have. I have a spout, and that makes me the queen of the tea table. I spread abroad a blessing on thirsting mankind, for in me the Chinese leaves are brewed in the boiling, tasteless water."""
the-teapot,All this said the teapot in its fresh young life.
the-teapot,"It stood on the table that was spread for tea; it was lifted by a very delicate hand, but the delicate hand was awkward."
the-teapot,"The teapot fell, the spout snapped off, and the handle snapped off."
the-teapot,The lid was no worse to speak of; the worst had been spoken of that.
the-teapot,"The teapot lay in a swoon on the floor, while the boiling water ran out of it."
the-teapot,"It was a horrid shame, but the worst was that everybody jeered at it; they jeered at the teapot and not at the awkward hand."
the-teapot,"""I never shall forget that experience,"" said the teapot, when it afterward talked of its life."
the-teapot,"""I was called an invalid, and placed in a corner, and the next day was given to a woman who begged for victuals. I fell into poverty, and stood dumb both outside and in. But then, just as I was, began my better life. One can be one thing and still become quite another. ""Earth was placed in me."
the-teapot,"For a teapot, this is the same as being buried, but in the earth was placed a flower bulb."
the-teapot,"Who placed it there, who gave it, I know not; but given it was, and it became a compensation for the Chinese leaves and the boiling water, a compensation for the broken handle and spout."
the-teapot,"""And the bulb lay in the earth, the bulb lay in me; it became my heart, my living heart, such as I had never before possessed. There was life in me, power and might. The heart pulsed, and the bulb put forth sprouts; it was the springing up of thoughts and feelings which burst forth into flower. ""I saw it, I bore it, I forgot myself in its delight."
the-teapot,Blessed is it to forget oneself in another.
the-teapot,The flower gave me no thanks; it did not think of me.
the-teapot,"It was admired and praised, and I was glad at that."
the-teapot,How happy it must have been!
the-teapot,One day I heard some one say that the flower deserved a better pot.
the-teapot,"I was thumped hard on my back, which was a great affliction, and the flower was put into a better pot."
the-teapot,"I was thrown out into the yard, where I lie as an old potsherd."
the-teapot,"But I have the memory, and that I can never lose."""
