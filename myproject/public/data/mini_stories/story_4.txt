Once upon a time, there was a thoughtful girl named Sue. Sue loved to help her mom around the house. One day, her mom asked her to wipe the table after they ate their lunch. Sue was happy to help.
As Sue was wiping the table, she saw a pretty candle on the window sill. The candle was her mom's favorite. Sue wanted to do something nice for her mom, so she said, "Mom, can I light the candle for you?" Her mom said, "Yes, but be very careful."
Sue carefully lit the candle and put it on the table. Her mom was so happy to see the pretty candle. They both sat and watched the candle burn. Sue's mom said, "Thank you, Sue, for being so thoughtful and careful." Sue felt proud that she could help her mom.
The moral of the story is to always be thoughtful and careful when helping others.
