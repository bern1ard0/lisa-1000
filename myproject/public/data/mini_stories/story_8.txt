Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. He loved to play with his red ball. One sunny day, Tom went outside to play with his ball in the land near his home.
Tom kicked the ball high in the sky. The ball went far, far away. Tom was sad because he could not find his ball. He walked and walked, looking for it. The land was big and sometimes dangerous. Tom knew he had to be careful.
At last, Tom found his ball near a big tree. He was very happy. Tom knew he should not kick the ball too hard next time. He went back home, holding his ball tightly. Tom played safely in his yard, away from the dangerous land.
